    Helpful functions and attributes
    -------------------------------
    ``self.player`` is assigned by the game engine and exposes many helpers for
    making decisions. Some commonly used ones are listed below.

    ``self.player.get_affordable_routes()`` -> ``List[tuple[Route, int]]``
        Returns the routes you can currently afford and the locomotives required.
        Example::

            options = self.player.get_affordable_routes()
            if options:
                route, loco_needed = options[0]

    ``self.player.get_tickets()`` -> ``List[DestinationTicket]``
        Your destination tickets. Each ticket has ``city1``, ``city2``,
        ``value`` and ``is_completed`` attributes.
        Example::

            incomplete = [t for t in self.player.get_tickets() if not t.is_completed]

    ``self.player.get_hand()`` -> ``Counter[str]``
        Current train cards in hand, keyed by color letter.
        Example::

            red_cards = self.player.get_hand().get('R', 0)

    ``self.player.trains_remaining``
        How many trains you still have available.
        Example::

            if self.player.trains_remaining <= 2:
                # game will end soon
                pass

    ``self.player.context`` -> :class:`PlayerContext`
        Snapshot of public game state each turn. Useful fields include:

        - ``face_up_cards``: visible train cards in the market.
          Example::

              first = self.player.context.face_up_cards[0]

        - ``map``: :class:`MapGraph` representing the board. You can inspect
          routes via ``self.player.context.map.get_available_routes()`` or
          ``get_claimed_routes(player_id)``.

        - ``opponents``: list of ``OpponentInfo`` with each opponent's exposed
          cards, remaining trains, score and ticket count.
          Example::

              for opp in self.player.context.opponents:
                  print(opp.player_id, opp.score)

        - ``turn_number``: current turn index.
        - ``score``: your current score so far.
